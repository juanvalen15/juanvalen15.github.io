# [](#header-1)About

My name is Juan David Valencia Payan. I am from Buga, Colombia. I am working in The Netherlands as a PhD Research Scholar at Eindhoven University of Technology. My research project is about "Mixed-time criticality control systems".

For the past seven years I have moved to Poland, Brazil, Germany and now The Netherlands. I went to Brazil after finishing Bachelors’ in Electronics Engineering. After finishing Masters’ I am currently pursuing PhD with focus on real-time embedded control systems. I am passionate about engineering, social work, sports, and meeting new people.

During my free time I swim, surf, run, bike, read, travel, and play the guitar or the ukulele.
